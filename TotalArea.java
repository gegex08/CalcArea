 * Programmer: Geneiva Ocampo
 * Course CSCI 1471
 * Date 02/25/2024
 * Assignment: Homework #5: CalcArea
 * Environment Java with Netbeans
 * Files Included: CalcArea & TotalArea
 * Purpose: To write an app that allows user get the total sum of areas from different shapes
 * Input: number of shapes, number from 1-3
 * Preconditions/ Assumptions: number on type of shape is an integer from 1-3
 * Equations: for Triangle (Base*Height*1/2) for Rectangle (Length*Width) for Circle (Ï€r^2)
 * Output:Enter the number of shapes:, 
 * Enter shape number (1-triangle, 2-rectangle, 3-circle):, 
 * Enter base for the triangle:
 * Enter height for the triangle:
 * Enter length for the rectangle:
 * Enter width for the rectangle:
 * Enter the radius for the circle:
 * Total area: (sum of all shapes area)
 * Postconditions/Assumptions: Data Type of double Variables and int variables
 * Contraints: variable data types are double for base, height, length, width, radius and int for numShapes and shape selection
 * Algorithm: 
 * Ask User for the number of shapes
 * if user enters number of shapes ask for int value of shape
 * if user enters 1 ask for user input for base and height then calculate area of triangle then add to the total of the sum of areas
 * if user enters 2 ask for user input for length and width then calculate area of square then add to the total of the sum of areas
 * if user enters 3 ask for user input for radius, then calculate area of circle, then add to the total of the sum of areas
 * if user enters any other integer invalid number message
 * if the number of shapes has reached max, output the total combined sum of areas
